Hive Java SDK can be called by client applications and internally encapsulates the Restful HTTP interface presented by Hive Node, providing the ability to save application data to it.

This chapter introduces how to integrate Java SDK in applications through simple file upload examples and shows key code segments to guide developers to realize corresponding application functions.\
\
If developers have other code details outside the code segment, please refer to the corresponding overall sample repository code.
