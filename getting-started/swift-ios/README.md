# Swift/iOS

Hive Swift SDK is a Swift version of SDK that can be called by client applications. It internally encapsulates the Restful HTTP interface presented by Hive Node and provides the ability to save application data to it.

This chapter introduces how to integrate Swift SDK in an application through simple file upload examples, while also showing key code segments to guide developers to realize corresponding application functions.\
\
If developers have other code details outside the code segments, please refer to the corresponding overall sample repository code.
