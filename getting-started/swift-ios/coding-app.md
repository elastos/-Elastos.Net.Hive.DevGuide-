本章通过实现最基础的文件数据上传功能来指导如何开发使用 Hive Swift SDK（本章内简称 SDK），并通过关键代码段展示在应用中对于相应接口调用和对象维护，

This chapter guides how to develop and use Hive Swift SDK (hereinafter referred to as SDK in this chapter) by realizing the most basic file data upload function, and shows the corresponding interface call and object maintenance in the application through key code segments.

### 准备 DID

Prepare DID

开发者应该需要了解到，在向后端存储 Vault 数据时，会涉及到四个DID：

Developers should be aware that when saving Vault data to the back end, there will be four DID:

* 应用程序 DID
* 应用程序实例 DID
* 用户 DID
* 后端Hive Node服务 DID
* Application DID
* Application instance DID
* User DID
* Back-end Hive Node service DID

其中，应用程序 DID 由开发人员通过在 Essentials 为该应用程序生成一个DID，并需要将该 DID 公开上链，编译后续该应用程序需求向Essentials 授权时验证其应用程序的合规性。而应用程序实例DID 表示应此应用程序运行在Android 或者 iOS 设备上一个独一无二应用实例。该应用实例 DID 需要开发人员在应用程序内安装时一次生成，但不需要公开上链，仅在应用程序作为用户的 Agent 在登录 Hive Node服务时作登入时验证时使用。

Among them, the application DID is generated by the developers in Essentials for the application, and the DID needs to be publicly put on the chain. Then the application needs to be compiled to verify the compliance of its application when it is authorized to Essentials. The application instance DID stands for a unique application instance that should be run on Android or iOS devices. The application instance DID needs to be generated at one time when the developer installs it in the application, but it doesn’t need to be publicly put on the chain. It can only be used when the application, as the user’s Agent, performs login verification when logging in to Hive Node service.

每个使用应用程序具有唯一的DID身份，用户需要在 Essentials 中生成该 DID，同时需要公开上链。完成上链后保管在 Essentials 中，用户后续应用登录时授权使用。后端 Hive Node 服务 DID，跟应用程序实例 DID类似，也是唯一代表该Hive 服务的实例 DID，但是需要公开上链供前端应用交互时双向验证使用。

Each application has a unique DID identity, and users need to generate the DID in Essentials, and at the same time, they need to disclose the cochain. After that, it is kept in Essentials, and users are authorized to use it when logging in for subsequent applications. Back-end Hive Node service DID, similar to application instance DID, is the only instance DID that represents this Hive service, but it needs to be exposed for the two-way authentication when front-end applications interact.

用于通过在 Essentials 中授权使用指定 DID 身份登录应用程序。在向 后端 Hive Node 请求登录时，需要通过 Essnetials 授权向应用程序实例（实例DID）颁发一个请求登录的凭证。Hive Node 通过验证该登录凭证的真实性，才授权向前端应用发布一个 access token，后续应用通过该 access token来存储和访问 Vault 中的数据。

The specified DID identity authorized in Essentials is used to log in to the application. When requesting login from the back-end Hive Node, you need to issue a credential requesting login to the application instance (instance DID) through authorization of Essentials. Hive Node authorizes to issue an access token to the front-end application by verifying the authenticity of the login credentials, and subsequent applications use the access token to save and access the data in the Vault.

### 创建 Vault

Create Vault

用户通过 Xcode 工具创建应用框架后，通过 SDK 实例化 Vault 对象，然后通过 Vault 对象来获取对应的子服务接口。在实例化 Vault 对象时，需要准备好一定的程序上下文环境。这里我们需要使用 AppContext 和 Hive Node Provider URL地址。创建 AppContext 会用到 Application Instance DID 和 User DID 。

After the user creates the application framework through Xcode tool, the Vault object is instantiated through SDK, and then the corresponding sub-service interface is obtained through the Vault object. When instantiating a Vault object, you need to prepare a certain program context environment. We need to use AppContext and Hive Node Provider URL address here. The Application Instance DID and User DID are used to create AppContext.

```
public class TestAppContextProvider: AppContextProvider {
    public func getAuthorization(_ authenticationChallengeJWTcode: String) -> Promise<String>? {
        return Promise<String> { resolver in
            resolver.fulfill(signAuthorization(authenticationChallengeJWTcode)!)
        }
    }
    
    public var appInstanceDid: AppDID
    public var userDid: UserDID
    private var localDataDir: String

    public func getLocalDataDir() -> String? {
        self.localDataDir
    }
    
    public func getAppInstanceDocument() -> DIDDocument? {
        return try! appInstanceDid.getDocument()
    }
    
    init(_ path: String, _ userDid: UserDID, _ appInstanceDid: AppDID) {
        self.localDataDir = path
        self.userDid = userDid
        self.appInstanceDid = appInstanceDid
    }
    
    public func signAuthorization(_ jwtToken: String) -> String? {
        
        var accessToken: String?
        let semaphore: DispatchSemaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)
        DispatchQueue.global().async { [self] in
            do {
                let claims = try JwtParserBuilder().build().parseClaimsJwt(jwtToken).claims
                let iss = claims.getIssuer()
                let nonce = claims.get(key: "nonce") as? String
                
                let vc = try userDid.issueDiplomaFor(appInstanceDid)
                let vp: VerifiablePresentation = try appInstanceDid.createPresentation(vc, iss!, nonce!)
                let token = try appInstanceDid.createToken(vp, iss!)
                accessToken = token
                semaphore.signal()
            } catch{
                print(error)
                semaphore.signal()
            }
        }
        semaphore.wait()
        return accessToken!
    }
}

let context = try AppContext.build(TestAppContextProvider(STORE-PATH, USER-DID, APPINSTANCE-DID), USER-DID)
```

同时通过选择可信的Hive Node 服务节点，填充对应的 Hive Node 地址作为 Provider address 参数。有了 AppContext 对象和 Provider address，就可以实例化已存在的 Vault service 对象：

Meanwhile, the corresponding Hive Node address is filled as the Provider address parameter by selecting trusted Hive Node service nodes. With AppContext object and Provider address, you can instantiate the existing Vault service object:

```
let vault = Vault(context, providerAddress)
```

### 获取 FileService 接口

Get FileService interface

因为示例中仅涉及文件上传功能，这里只需获取FileService接口即可，具体调用接口如下：

Because the example only involves the file upload function, we only need to get the FileService interface, and the specific call interface is as follows:

```
let fileService = vault.fileService
```

### 上传文件

Upload file

一旦获取 FilesService 接口实例后，便可以通过该接口来将文件数据上传到 Vault serivce中。在实现上传文件时，先获取用于写的 Writer ，然后将文件内容写入完成整个上传文件数据的流程。

Once the FilesService interface instance is obtained, the file data can be uploaded to the Vault service through this interface. When a file is uploading, the Writer for writing ought to be gotten firstly, and then the file content is written to complete the whole process of uploading file data.

```
self.scriptOwner.filesService.getUploadWriter(remoteImagePath).then { writer in
            return try writer.write(data: self.imgDate)
        }.done { success in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                let text = success == true ? "upload image: success" : "upload image: false"

               print(text)
				// handle your data ......
            }
        }.catch { error in
               print(error)
        }
```
